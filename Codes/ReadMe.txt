GA.R is used to generate simulation data

Division of communities.py and LD.py are used for linkage disequilibrium analysis of simulation data

FastNewman. m, GetModularity.m and main.m are a group of MATLAB program files used to divide communities

Finally, yuce_SNP.m uses MLR to predict the accuracy of division results

It should be noted that the applicable environment of GA.R is based on Linux system and depends on hapgen2
